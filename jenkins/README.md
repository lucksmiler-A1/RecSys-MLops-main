# Jenkins Path-Based CI/CD

Root `Jenkinsfile` is the component-aware CI/CD entrypoint. It detects changed
paths, runs only the affected component gates, pushes only the affected images,
and updates only the affected deployed component on `main`.

## GitHub Webhook Flow

The in-cluster Jenkins chart seeds a Pipeline-from-SCM job named
`RecSys-GitHub-CICD`. The job points to the GitHub repository and reads the root
`Jenkinsfile`; CI/CD behavior stays in source control instead of inside the
Jenkins UI.

```text
GitHub push/PR
  -> GitHub Webhook
  -> Jenkins /github-webhook/
  -> RecSys-GitHub-CICD job
  -> Jenkinsfile
  -> Detect Changed Components
  -> Component CI
  -> Component Build And Publish
  -> Component Deploy Or Update only when branch is main
```

Webhook settings:

```text
Payload URL: https://<production-gateway>/github-webhook/
Content type: application/json
Events: push and pull_request
```

The Helm chart exposes only `/github-webhook/` through the ingress controller.

`jenkins/config/components.json` is the source of truth for path
rules. `jenkins/python/change_detection/detector.py` evaluates those rules, and
`jenkins/python/release_plan.py` resolves image, artifact, and deploy-unit fan-out.
They write `.ci-components.env` and `.ci-release-plan.json` so Jenkins can run
the matching component stages while building each image and deploying each
release only once.

Documentation and generated evidence paths (`docs/`, Markdown, images,
`graphify-out/`, CI reports) are explicitly ignored and produce
`CHANGED_COMPONENTS=unchanged`. Jenkins/controller configuration produces only
`RUN_CI_CONFIG=true` without inventing a product component; it no longer fans
out to every application pipeline. Any non-documentation path without a routing rule fails closed with an
`Unmapped runtime path` error so a new component cannot silently run everything
or skip validation.

Analytics changes set `RUN_ANALYTICS=true` in the main webhook flow. The shared
pipeline runs analytics unit and contract tests plus Helm validation, publishes
the unified Spark, dbt, Superset, and Airflow images, and upgrades the
independently owned Airflow and analytics Helm releases on `main`.

Progressive rollout changes set `RUN_ROLLOUT=true`. The same main webhook flow
tests the controller, model-CD contracts, Helm templates, and demo scripts;
publishes the watcher image with the Git commit tag; and applies only the
watcher Deployment on `main`. The deploy step runs the idempotent Jenkins seed
through `/scriptText`, updating rollout jobs without restarting the Jenkins
controller. `RecSys-KServe-Model-CD` is Pipeline-from-SCM, so every runtime rollout
stage checks out `jenkins/KServeModelCD.Jenkinsfile` and its scripts from the
current main revision instead of using a manually synchronized workspace.

For push builds, Jenkins compares `GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT...HEAD`. Pull requests use
the target branch merge base. `HEAD~1` is only a first-build fallback. This makes
multi-commit pushes and repeated builds deterministic while preserving a valid
empty diff as unchanged.

A documentation-only push is expected to log `Changed components: unchanged`;
CI configuration validation, product CI, image publishing, and deployment must
all remain skipped for that build.

## Stage Contract

Each changed component follows the same sequence:

1. Component unit tests with `pytest-cov` and `COVERAGE_MIN`, default `90`.
2. Component integration tests from `tests/integration/<component>/` when present.
3. Existing contract tests relevant to the component.
4. Docker build and vulnerability scan with the full `GIT_COMMIT` tag.
5. Push to the production Artifact Registry and resolve an immutable digest.
6. Deploy the digest to GKE only on `main`, unless `FORCE_DEPLOY=true`.
7. Run component production smoke/workflow checks after all selected release
   layers are healthy.

Component CI is executed in bounded batches. The default maximum is three
parallel branches (`COMPONENT_CI_MAX_PARALLEL=3`) so the Jenkins controller pod
does not launch all thirteen heavy Python/Node test processes at once.

`jenkins/config/gcp-production.json` is the only production identity source.
The Jenkins job has no project, registry, cluster, or kubeconfig override.
Services pull `@sha256:` references; the pipeline does not deploy mutable tags.

The `training` component has an extra Kubeflow package gate: CI/CD builds and
pushes `recsys-mlops-training`, `recsys-spark`, and `recsys-mlflow`,
compiles `pipelines/kubeflow/compiled/bst_training_pipeline.yaml` with those real
image refs, validates and archives it, then uploads or versions the package in
Kubeflow. Runtime retrain jobs submit the uploaded pipeline by name/version and
do not read the generated YAML from a container filesystem.

Each Helm unit uses `upgrade --install --atomic --cleanup-on-fail --wait` and has
its own Jenkins lock. The release plan topologically orders dependencies and
parallelizes only independent releases. A failed Helm unit rolls back its own
revision; Jenkins stops later layers and does not run production workflow checks.
Kubeflow package upload, Feast registry apply, and rollout reconciliation are
explicit non-Helm deploy units in the same plan.

Production verification has a separate component dependency graph. A full run
checks DP1, DP2, DP3, materialization and training in that order regardless of
the order supplied in `FORCE_COMPONENTS`.

## Secrets

Jenkins runs as `ci/recsys-jenkins` and obtains Artifact Registry credentials
through Workload Identity Federation for GKE. Do not configure a static GCP
service-account JSON key. MinIO/S3, MLflow and model registry credentials are
loaded from Kubernetes Secrets only when model CD needs them.

Production application charts set `secret.create=false`. Terraform writes
central payloads in `external-secrets`, and the Terraform-owned
`recsys-security` release creates namespace-local ExternalSecrets. Jenkins
verifies each required ExternalSecret and target Secret before upgrading a
dependent release; it never renders secret values into Helm arguments.

Do not commit secret values into Jenkinsfile, Helm values, or scripts.

## Full Service CI/CD

Run the root Jenkins job with `FORCE_DEPLOY=true` and the complete component
list in `FORCE_COMPONENTS`:

```text
materialize,training,dp1,dp2,dp3,online_feature_api,inference_api,kserve,rollout,drift,stream_offline,stream_online,analytics,demo_web,ci_config
```

The root pipeline keeps a compact Stage View: Declarative checkout, Checkout,
Detect Changed Components, Python Env, Component CI, Docker Login, Component
Build And Publish, Component Deploy Or Update, and Declarative post actions.
Component CI still runs selected branches in parallel. Build/package and
preflight/deploy/verification retain their internal checkpoints and release
locks, but no longer create one UI column per checkpoint. Post-deploy
verification checks only applied resources, health endpoints, registered DAGs,
and uploaded KFP packages; it never starts Airflow DAGs, KFP runs, Spark jobs,
or synthetic production events.

Run the local preflight, then trigger the job through the Jenkins API:

```bash
make full-cicd-preflight

JENKINS_URL=https://jenkins.example.com \
JENKINS_USER=admin \
JENKINS_TOKEN="$JENKINS_TOKEN" \
make jenkins-full
```

Set `COMPONENT_CI_MAX_PARALLEL=2` on smaller controller pods. The trigger always
publishes images and requests production deployment; use the Jenkins
`PUBLISH_IMAGES=false` parameter only for a non-deploying build proof.
