# A/B Testing Proof

This proof covers the final-coursework rubric item **A/B Testing** on GCP/GKE project `rec-sys-503309`.

## Scope

| Rubric item | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Perform A/B traffic split for 2 versions of inference service | FastAPI uses `TritonABRouter` to route each user deterministically to control or candidate Triton/KServe gRPC service. |
| Deploy via CI/CD | Model CD renders the same Helm values used by Terraform/Jenkins; the GCP proof is applied through `helm_release.recsys_serving`. |
| Monitor 2 versions | Grafana dashboard `Model A/B Testing` monitors control vs candidate traffic, errors, latency, confidence, score shape, and Triton pod resources. |

Groundtruth assumption: we do not have online groundtruth labels in this proof, so the A/B dashboard uses proxy online metrics: HTTP success/error, empty recommendation rate, model latency, Triton latency, score shape, and confidence distribution.

## Current Full A/B Flow

The current implementation supports the full A/B lifecycle, but this proof document captures the traffic-split and monitoring state rather than a completed promotion run.

1. Produce model manifests.

   The training/promotion pipeline writes Triton model repository metadata into promotion manifests. In Model CD, the stable manifest is used as `control`, while a new manifest is passed as `candidate`.

2. Render serving values for the desired stage.

   The [model-CD CLI stage contract](../../../jenkins/python/model_cd/cli.py#L37)
   accepts these stages:

   | Stage | Purpose | Resulting A/B state |
   |---|---|---|
   | `deploy` | Deploy the stable production model only. | A/B disabled, candidate weight `0`. |
   | `shadow-start` | Deploy the candidate for mirrored traffic without returning its result. | Shadow enabled, user-visible A/B disabled. |
   | `ab-start` | Start an experiment with control and candidate manifests. | A/B enabled if candidate exists and weight > 0. |
   | `ab-step` | Continue or increase/decrease candidate exposure. | A/B enabled with the requested candidate weight. |
   | `evaluate` | Query current Prometheus samples and choose the next A/B step or rollback. | Writes a gate decision before changing exposure. |
   | `promote` | Make the candidate model the new stable serving model after gates pass. | Candidate becomes stable, A/B disabled, candidate weight `0`. |
   | `rollback` | Return to stable-only serving. | A/B disabled, candidate weight `0`. |

   The stage logic is implemented in
   [`write_values()`](../../../jenkins/python/model_cd/config.py#L6): A/B is
   enabled only for `ab-start` and `ab-step` when a candidate manifest exists
   and `candidate_weight_percent > 0`; shadow is enabled only for
   `shadow-start`.

3. Deploy two KServe/Triton inference services during A/B.

   [inferenceservice.yaml (line 1)](../../../infra/helm/recsys-serving/templates/inferenceservice.yaml#L1), [inferenceservice.yaml (line 78)](../../../infra/helm/recsys-serving/templates/inferenceservice.yaml#L78) always renders the control `InferenceService`. When A/B is enabled and `candidateStorageUri` is present, it also renders the candidate `InferenceService` with label `recsys.ai/ab-variant: candidate`.

4. Pass A/B config into the API pod.

   [api-configmap.yaml (line 15)](../../../infra/helm/recsys-serving/templates/api-configmap.yaml#L15), [api-configmap.yaml (line 26)](../../../infra/helm/recsys-serving/templates/api-configmap.yaml#L26) exposes the runtime config to FastAPI:

   ```text
   AB_TEST_ENABLED
   AB_EXPERIMENT_ID
   AB_CANDIDATE_WEIGHT_PERCENT
   AB_CONTROL_MODEL_VERSION
   AB_CANDIDATE_MODEL_VERSION
   AB_CONTROL_TRITON_URL
   AB_CANDIDATE_TRITON_URL
   ```

5. Route each recommendation request.

   [ab_testing.py (line 55)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L55), [ab_testing.py (line 107)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L107) builds one Triton ranker for `control` and one Triton ranker for `candidate`. `TritonABRouter.assign()` hashes `experiment_id:user_id` into a bucket from `0..99`; if the bucket is below `AB_CANDIDATE_WEIGHT_PERCENT`, the user is assigned to `candidate`, otherwise to `control`.

6. Return and monitor variant metadata.

   [ranking.py (line 99)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ranking.py#L99), [ranking.py (line 154)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ranking.py#L154) passes the selected route into the recommendation response, so each response includes `ab_variant`, `ab_experiment_id`, and `model_version`. The same labels are also attached to Prometheus metrics through [serving_utils.py (line 17)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/serving_utils.py#L17), [serving_utils.py (line 26)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/serving_utils.py#L26), which lets Grafana compare control and candidate request volume, errors, latency, confidence, and score shape.

7. Decide promote or rollback.

   [`evaluate_candidate_gates()`](../../../jenkins/python/model_cd/promotion_gates.py#L27)
   and
   [`assert_promote_gates()`](../../../jenkins/python/model_cd/promotion_gates.py#L107)
   implement the promotion gates:

   - Promote is allowed when candidate error rate is not more than `0.02` above control error rate.
   - Promote is allowed when candidate p95 latency is not more than `1.5x` control p95 latency.
   - Candidate confidence must remain at least `0.95x` the control confidence.
   - Both variants need the configured minimum fresh sample count.
   - A failed gate raises before the production manifest is updated.

   If the candidate passes and `--apply` is used, `promote` copies the candidate Triton repository into the stable serving URI, uploads the new production manifest, then renders a stable-only deploy with A/B disabled. If the candidate fails or the operator chooses not to continue, `rollback` renders stable-only values and sets candidate weight back to `0`.

Current proof status: this document proves that `ab-start`-style serving is active on GCP because both `recsys-bst-triton` and `recsys-bst-triton-candidate` are ready, live requests split into `control` and `candidate`, and Prometheus/Grafana expose per-variant metrics. It does not claim that `model_cd.py --stage promote` has already been executed for this experiment.

## Two Inference Services

```bash
kubectl get inferenceservice -n kserve-triton-inference
kubectl get svc -n kserve-triton-inference
kubectl get deploy,pod -n kserve-triton-inference
```

Observed result:

```text
NAME                          READY
recsys-bst-triton             True
recsys-bst-triton-candidate   True

```

### Image proof 

![Data & ML system](../../pngs/infer_service.png)

**Figure: Control and candidate Triton/KServe services.** This proof shows both A/B inference backends are deployed and ready: `recsys-bst-triton` is the stable control service, while `recsys-bst-triton-candidate` is the candidate service under evaluation. Their predictor services expose Triton gRPC on port `9000`, which is the internal endpoint used by the FastAPI recommendation API.

## Traffic Split Test

Run this from the workstation. It executes inside the API pod and calls the local API server, so it tests the real A/B router without depending on the public gateway or Docker local.

```bash
kubectl -n api-serving exec deploy/recsys-api-serving -c api -- \
  python -c 'import json, urllib.request, collections
counts=collections.Counter()
statuses=collections.Counter()
for user_id in range(1,81):
    payload={"user_id":user_id,"candidate_item_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],"top_k":5}
    req=urllib.request.Request("http://127.0.0.1:8080/recommendations", data=json.dumps(payload).encode(), headers={"Content-Type":"application/json"}, method="POST")
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=10) as res:
            body=json.loads(res.read().decode())
            counts[body.get("ab_variant") or "none"] += 1
            statuses[str(res.status)] += 1
    except Exception as exc:
        statuses[type(exc).__name__] += 1
print("statuses", dict(statuses))
print("variants", dict(counts))'
```

Observed result:

```text
statuses {'200': 80}
variants {'control': 38, 'candidate': 42}
```

What this proves:

- The test calls the live FastAPI container inside the GKE cluster, so it exercises the real API, online feature lookup, A/B router, and Triton/KServe inference path rather than a local mock.
- `statuses {'200': 80}` proves every request completed successfully after routing and inference. This is important because A/B is only useful if both model paths can serve production traffic without returning gateway or inference errors.
- `variants {'control': 38, 'candidate': 42}` proves traffic reached both variants. The split is close to the configured `AB_CANDIDATE_WEIGHT_PERCENT=50`, but it does not need to be exactly 40/40 because the router uses deterministic hashing over the finite user-id sample `1..80`.
- `control` maps to the current stable model path from `AB_CONTROL_TRITON_URL` and `AB_CONTROL_MODEL_VERSION`; `candidate` maps to the new model path from `AB_CANDIDATE_TRITON_URL` and `AB_CANDIDATE_MODEL_VERSION`.
- The split is sticky per user: the same `experiment_id:user_id` hashes to the same A/B bucket, so repeat calls for the same user stay on the same variant during the experiment.
- The response includes `ab_variant`, `ab_experiment_id`, and `model_version`, and the same labels are emitted to Prometheus. This lets Grafana compare request volume, errors, latency, confidence, and score shape separately for control and candidate.

The `ab_variant` value is not inferred from Kubernetes after the fact. It is an explicit response field emitted by the API:

- [api_schemas.py (line 16)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/api_schemas.py#L16), [api_schemas.py (line 23)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/api_schemas.py#L23): `RecommendationResponse` includes `ab_variant` and `ab_experiment_id`.
- [ab_testing.py (line 55)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L55), [ab_testing.py (line 89)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L89): `TritonABRouter.from_env()` creates a control Triton ranker with `ab_variant="control"` and a candidate Triton ranker with `ab_variant="candidate"`.
- [ab_testing.py (line 91)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L91), [ab_testing.py (line 107)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L107): `TritonABRouter.assign()` hashes `experiment_id:user_id` into a bucket and compares it with `AB_CANDIDATE_WEIGHT_PERCENT`.
- [ab_testing.py (line 121)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L121), [ab_testing.py (line 141)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ab_testing.py#L141): `TritonABRouter.route()` returns a `TritonRoute` carrying the selected `model_version`, `ab_variant`, and `ab_experiment_id`.
- [ranking.py (line 99)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ranking.py#L99), [ranking.py (line 176)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/ranking.py#L176): `recommend()` passes the route metadata into `format_top_k()`, so the API response exposes whether that request used `control` or `candidate`.
- [serving_utils.py (line 17)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/serving_utils.py#L17), [serving_utils.py (line 26)](../../../apps/api-serving/src/serving_utils.py#L26): `ab_labels()` also attaches `ab_variant`, `model_version`, and `experiment_id` to Prometheus metrics.

With `AB_CANDIDATE_WEIGHT_PERCENT=50`, the expected long-run candidate share is about 50%. This short proof uses only user IDs `1..80`, so the observed 42/80 candidate assignments are deterministic for this exact range and can differ slightly from exactly 50%. The key evidence is that both variants receive successful traffic and the response/metrics identify which model version served each request.

### Image proof to capture:

![Data & ML system](../../pngs/api_serve_exec_ab.png)

**Figure: API-level A/B traffic split proof.** This screenshot should capture the terminal output from the in-cluster request loop. The `statuses` line proves the API served the test traffic successfully, and the `variants` line proves the router sent requests to both `control` and `candidate` model versions.

## Grafana Dashboard

Dashboard: `Model A/B Testing`

Panels prepared for screenshots:

| Panel | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Prediction Rate | Request rate for the selected experiment. |
| Candidate Share | Actual candidate share observed by Prometheus. |
| Error Delta | Candidate error rate minus control error rate. |
| P95 Latency Delta | Candidate p95 latency minus control p95 latency. |
| Prediction Rate by Variant, Version, Status | Main table/time series for A/B result. |
| Current Traffic Split | Pie chart of control vs candidate. |
| Router Assignment Count | Confirms deterministic router assignment counts. |
| Model P95 Latency | Per-variant latency from `model_prediction_latency_seconds_bucket`. |
| Confidence Average / Distribution | Proxy quality without groundtruth. |
| Triton Pod CPU / Memory / Restarts | Runtime health for both inference services. |

### Image proof 

![Data & ML system](../../pngs/ab_dashboard_1.png)

**Figure: A/B rollout overview dashboard.** This screenshot should show the top-level model A/B monitoring panels: overall prediction rate, candidate share, error delta, latency delta, and traffic split for the selected experiment. It proves Grafana is reading variant-labeled Prometheus metrics instead of only showing one global serving metric.

![Data & ML system](../../pngs/ab_dashboard_2.png)

**Figure: Per-variant model health dashboard.** This screenshot should focus on panels that compare `control` and `candidate` by `ab_variant` and `model_version`, such as prediction rate by status, router assignment count, model latency, and empty/error responses.

![Data & ML system](../../pngs/ab_dashboard_3.png)

**Figure: Proxy quality metrics dashboard.** Because online groundtruth labels are not available in this proof, this screenshot should show proxy model-quality signals such as confidence average, confidence distribution, score mean/max, and recommendation item/candidate counts for each variant.

![Data & ML system](../../pngs/ab_dashboard_4.png)

**Figure: Triton runtime health dashboard.** This screenshot should show the control and candidate Triton/KServe pod resource panels, including CPU, memory, and restart count. It proves both inference backends remain healthy while A/B traffic is being served.
