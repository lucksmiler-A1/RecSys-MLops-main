# Infrastructure As Code Proof: RecSys MLOps On GCP

This document records the final Infrastructure as Code setup deployed to Google Cloud for the coursework project.

## Target Project

- GCP project: `rec-sys-503309`
- Project number: `455131526306`
- Region: `asia-southeast1`
- Zone: `asia-southeast1-b`
- GKE cluster: `recsys-mlops-gke`
- Artifact Registry: `asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/rec-sys-503309/recsys`

## IaC Layout

The production IaC is split by cloud resource and independently owned
application release:

    registry_storage.tf         # Artifact Registry and GCS buckets
    recsys_services.tf          # Helm releases for the RecSys stack
    secret_management.tf        # External Secrets and workload identity bindings
    secrets.tf                  # Central secret payload resources
    variables.tf                # deployment toggles and node sizing
```

Terraform provisions the cloud resources, installs required controllers, creates namespaces, and deploys local Helm charts. This makes the setup reproducible from IaC instead of relying on manual Kubernetes setup.

## Historical Cloud Build Image Proof

The following capture is historical evidence from the earlier coursework
runtime. Its `:gcp` tags and nine-image list are not the current release
contract. Cloud Build, `infra/cloudbuild`, and `recsys-dataflow-cli` have been
retired.

```bash
gcloud builds submit \
  --config infra/cloudbuild/recsys-images.yaml \
  --project rec-sys-503309
```

Do not run that command on the current tree. Current delivery validates
[`images/catalog.json`](../../../images/catalog.json), builds/scans the
15-image dependency graph in Jenkins, publishes commit-tagged images, resolves
their digests, and deploys only `@sha256:` references. The implementation is in
[`release_build_publish.sh`](../../../jenkins/scripts/entrypoints/release_build_publish.sh)
and [`engine.sh`](../../../jenkins/scripts/build/engine.sh).

## Terraform Proof

Terraform was applied from `infra/terraform/gcp` against project `rec-sys-503309`.

Validation:

```bash
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/gcp validate
```

Observed result:

```text
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

### Image proof

![Cloud Build proof](../../pngs/validate_config_tf.png)

Final convergence check:

```bash
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/gcp plan -detailed-exitcode -no-color
```

Observed result:

```text
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration
and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

### Image proof 

![Cloud Build proof](../../pngs/convergence_proof.png)

## GKE Node Split

The cluster is intentionally split into two active node pools:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -L recsys.ai/workload,recsys.ai/pool,node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
```

Observed result:

```text
NAME                                                  STATUS   VERSION               WORKLOAD        POOL           INSTANCE-TYPE
gke-recsys-mlops-gke-recsys-mlops-cpu-d4791f44-714z   Ready    v1.35.5-gke.1163012   data-platform   cpu-services   e2-standard-8
gke-recsys-mlops-gke-recsys-mlops-ml--f31561e0-ltbt   Ready    v1.35.5-gke.1163012   ml-system       ml-system      e2-standard-4
```

Node pool service placement:

Kubernetes `Service` objects are virtual network front doors and are not
scheduled to a node by themselves. The node split is therefore proven by where
the backing pods run. The services below are grouped by the node pool selected
by their pod `nodeSelector`/toleration policy.

| Node pool | Scheduled service/workload group | Kubernetes services and pods behind it | Why it runs there |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cpu-services` | Data ingestion and feature data platform | `source-postgres`, `airflow-postgres`, `feature-postgres`, `data-platform-minio`, `kafka`, `kafka-connect`, `redis`, `flink-jobmanager`, `flink-taskmanager`, `airflow-webserver`, `airflow-scheduler`, `realtime-event-producer`, `realtime-flink-online-store`, `realtime-flink-offline-store` | Keeps streaming, batch orchestration, feature-store writes, and data-generator traffic on the larger CPU data-platform node. |
| `cpu-services` | Observability, gateway, governance, CI/CD, and control plane | `recsys-grafana`, `recsys-prometheus`, `recsys-loki`, `recsys-tempo`, `recsys-pushgateway`, exporters, `datahub-frontend`, `datahub-gms`, Jenkins `recsys-jenkins`, in-cluster registry `recsys-registry`, NGINX ingress controller, KEDA, cert-manager, KServe controller, Istio control plane, Kubeflow Pipelines control services | These are platform/control-plane services. They support the whole stack and do not need to consume capacity on the isolated ML serving node. |
| `ml-system` | Experiment tracking and model store | MLflow service `mlflow`, MLflow Postgres service `postgres`, MLflow MinIO service `minio`, MinIO bucket init job | Terraform applies the shared `ml-system` node selector/toleration to the MLflow Helm release so experiment tracking and model artifacts stay close to model serving. |
| `ml-system` | Online serving APIs | FastAPI recommendation service `recsys-api-serving`, FastAPI online feature service `recsys-online-feature-api`, KEDA HTTP targets/ScaledObjects for those services | API pods are pinned to the tainted ML node so online inference traffic is isolated from Kafka/Flink/Airflow load. |
| `ml-system` | Model inference runtime | KServe `InferenceService` `recsys-bst-triton`, optional candidate `recsys-bst-triton-candidate`, predictor services `recsys-bst-triton-predictor` and `recsys-bst-triton-candidate-predictor` exposing Triton HTTP and gRPC ports | Triton/KServe predictor pods are pinned to the ML node. The recommendation API calls Triton through the predictor service gRPC port `9000` and receives promoted model updates from the KServe CD flow. |

The placement is defined in Terraform/Helm:

- [gke.tf (line 97)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/gke.tf#L97), [gke.tf (line 191)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/gke.tf#L191): defines the `cpu-services` and tainted `ml-system` node pools.
- [locals.tf (line 40)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/locals.tf#L40), [locals.tf (line 85)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/locals.tf#L85): reusable ML node selectors and tolerations for ML and serving workloads.
- [recsys_services.tf (line 44)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/recsys_services.tf#L44), [recsys_services.tf (line 111)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/recsys_services.tf#L111), [recsys_services.tf (line 158)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/recsys_services.tf#L158), [recsys_services.tf (line 223)](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/recsys_services.tf#L223): applies ML placement to MLflow, APIs, KServe/Triton, and Ray releases.

The `ml-system` node pool has a taint:

```text
recsys.ai/workload=ml-system:NoSchedule
```

Only workloads with the matching toleration and node selector are scheduled there. This is why API serving, online feature lookup, MLflow, the model-store MinIO, MLflow Postgres, and Triton/KServe predictors are placed on the ML node.

Some Kubernetes and GKE DaemonSet pods run on both nodes, such as logging, metrics, networking, DNS, storage, and metadata agents. That is expected for per-node system services.

### Node `cpu-services` services

![Helm release proof](../../pngs/mlops_cpu_node_.png)

**Figure: `cpu-services` node proof.** This image should show the data platform and control-plane pods on the CPU node: Kafka, Redis, Flink, Airflow, data-platform Postgres/MinIO, DataHub, observability, Jenkins, gateway, Kubeflow/KServe controllers, and GKE system DaemonSets.

### Node `ml-system` services

![Helm release proof](../../pngs/ml_node_pods.png)

**Figure: `ml-system` node proof.** This image should show the isolated ML/runtime pods on the tainted ML node: MLflow, MLflow Postgres, MLflow MinIO model store, `recsys-api-serving`, `recsys-online-feature-api`, and the KServe/Triton predictor pods. Some per-node DaemonSet pods can also appear here because logging, metrics, mesh, networking, and storage agents must run on every node.

The monolithic `recsys-data-platform` row is historical. The current production
tree replaces it with `recsys-data-config`, `recsys-data-lakehouse`,
`recsys-source-store`, `recsys-event-stream`, `recsys-feature-store`,
`recsys-kafka-connect`, `recsys-streaming`, and `recsys-airflow`. Terraform
bootstraps those releases and then ignores runtime mutations; Jenkins is the
only release operator after bootstrap. See the authoritative release resources
in [`recsys_services.tf`](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/recsys_services.tf) and
the migration contract in
[`infra/terraform/gcp/README.md`](../../../infra/terraform/gcp/README.md).
