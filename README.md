# End-to-End E-commerce Recommendation Platform

A **production-style, end-to-end recommendation platform** for data engineering, machine learning, deployment, serving, governance, and observability workflows on Kubernetes.

## 🛍️ Business Domain

This project is an end-to-end recommendation platform for e-commerce. It turns catalog, user, session, impression, behavior, and order data into batch and real-time features, trains a Behavior Sequence Transformer (BST), and serves personalized Top-K product recommendations through a production-style MLOps workflow.

---

## 📝 System Overview

- **Data and analytics platform:** Generates configurable historical and real-time e-commerce events in PostgreSQL and MinIO, then streams CDC records through Debezium and Kafka. Spark builds batch features and Iceberg Bronze/Silver/Gold tables, while Flink handles event-time processing, deduplication, watermarking, streaming quality windows, and online feature updates. Airflow orchestrates ingestion, validation, compaction, materialization, drift, and analytics workflows; Feast serves PostgreSQL offline features and Redis online features; Hudi, DataHub, Trino, dbt, Superset, and Evidently provide dataset versioning, lineage, governed analytics, data quality, and drift monitoring.

- **ML training and retraining platform:** Trains a PyTorch Behavior Sequence Transformer with time-aware datasets, negative sampling, ranking metrics, checkpointing, and ONNX/Triton model packaging. Kubeflow Pipelines coordinates data preparation, KubeRay/Ray Tune hyperparameter search and distributed training, evaluation, and promotion. MLflow uses PostgreSQL for tracking and registry metadata and MinIO for artifacts and versioned models; offline NDCG gates, feature-drift checks, and online candidate error/latency gates control promotion and drift-triggered retraining.

- **Serving, infrastructure, and delivery:** FastAPI retrieves Feast online features, calls the Triton V2 inference API, ranks candidates, and returns personalized Top-K recommendations through NGINX. KServe manages stable and candidate Triton deployments, while KEDA HTTP/resource scalers and HPA policies autoscale API and inference workloads. Terraform and Helm provision GCP/GKE and Kubernetes resources; Jenkins validates the 15-image catalog and automates testing, immutable image publishing, deployment, shadow traffic, sticky progressive A/B rollout, model promotion, champion fallback, Helm rollback, and candidate cleanup.

- **Web UI module:** Provides a React, TypeScript, Vite, and TanStack Query storefront served by a non-root NGINX container, backed by a same-origin FastAPI API. The backend uses a bounded PostgreSQL connection pool for transactional user, event, and order writes, and calls the feature and recommendation services to exercise the complete `PostgreSQL → Debezium → Kafka → Flink → Redis/Feast → Triton` real-time path. The frontend and backend are released atomically with Helm and include ingress routing, PDBs, External Secrets, Prometheus/OpenTelemetry instrumentation, CI security checks, deployment smoke tests, and revision-based rollback.

- **Security and observability:** Vault and External Secrets Operator manage runtime credentials; Istio mTLS, authorization policies, and Kubernetes NetworkPolicies secure service-to-service communication. Prometheus and Pushgateway collect infrastructure, pipeline, quality, drift, API, and model-rollout metrics; Grafana provides dashboards and alerts, Loki/Promtail centralize logs, and Tempo/OpenTelemetry provide distributed tracing.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Overall System Flow

The following diagram presents the **End-to-End Platform** architecture documented in [high-level system design](<docs/submission/rubic-final-coursework-(final-ml)/high_level_system_design.md>).

![End-to-End Recommendation Platform Architecture](docs/pngs/overview.png)

### Serving Pipeline High-Level Architecture

The serving module retrieves fresh online features, routes stable, candidate, or shadow traffic, scores candidates with KServe/Triton, and returns Top-K recommendations.

### Progressive A/B Testing and Automatic Rollback

The model-delivery controller turns an MLflow candidate into a shadow deployment, then progressively exposes sticky user traffic at **10% → 25% → 50%**. At every step, Jenkins evaluates fresh control/candidate samples from Prometheus; a regression immediately restores champion-only traffic, while a final pass promotes the candidate and removes the temporary Triton service. See [A/B testing](<docs/submission/rubic-final-coursework-(final-ml)/ab_testing.md>) and [progressive rollout details](<docs/submission/rubic-final-coursework-(final-ml)/noval_ideas.md>).

### Ranking Sequence Model Architecture

The ranking model follows the architecture in [*Behavior Sequence Transformer for E-commerce Recommendation in Alibaba*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06874): positional and item features represent the ordered behavior sequence, a Transformer captures dependencies between interactions, and its target-item representation is combined with user, item, context, and cross features for CTR prediction.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Inputs["Input Features"]
    Other["Other Features<br/>user, item, context, cross"]
    SequenceItems["Behavior Sequence + Target Item<br/>item_id, category_id"]
    Position["Positional Features<br/>relative interaction time"]
  end
